# 🔧 TiraRTL

**TiraRTL** is a personal collection of reusable **RTL-level Verilog HDL modules** developed for **digital design, FPGA, and VLSI projects**.

The aim of this repository is to maintain **clean, well-structured, and tested Verilog modules** that can be easily reused across multiple designs and learning experiments.

Each module is written with:
- Clear RTL intent
- Readable and modular code
- Reusability across projects in mind

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Module | Description | File |
|--------|-------------|------|
| BCD to 7-Segment Display | Converts a BCD input into corresponding 7-segment display signals | [`bcd_to_7seg.v`](bcd_to_7seg.v) |

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a reusable **RTL module library**
- Strengthen understanding of **digital logic and Verilog HDL**
- Support **FPGA prototyping** and **VLSI design workflows**
- Maintain clean and synthesizable RTL code

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Verilog HDL**
- RTL-level design methodology

---

## 📌 Note
This repository will continue to expand as more RTL modules are designed, verified, and added.
